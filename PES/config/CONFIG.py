## Notes:
## According to the original specs, the experiment will be divided in 6 to 8 "blocks", each comprising 8-12 "sequences
## of trials". For the purposes of the current code, these terms are understood as follows:
##   - Sequence   : A single map scene on which you annotate several cities, constitutes a 'sequence' of trials.
##   - Trial      : Each city the Agent annotates (e.g. with the mouse) on a map is a 'trial'.
##   - Block      : A collection of 8 to 12 sequences (i.e. maps)
##   - Experiment : A collection of blocks, intended to be completed by a participant in a single experimental session
##                  (with optional breaks after every few blocks).
