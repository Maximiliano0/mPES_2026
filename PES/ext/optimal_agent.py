PES - Pandemic Experiment Scenario

(Quasi)Optimal Agent

The pandemic experiments has a damage function for each city which is a dynamical map.  The task of any agent is to solve the integer partition problem for the number of MAX_ALLOCATABLE_RESOURCES, in units of AVAILABLE_RESOURCES_PER_SEQUENCE.
But this must be done in a way that the severity of each city, governed by the dynamical map, arrives to zero as close as possible by the end of the sequence.

Hence, a ground-truth solution can be approximated for this problem if we first find the zeros of the dynamical map, and then use the responses that can cause exactly that (as close as possible).

This code does exactly that, and stores the deciding function p[state][remaining sequence length] in optimal.pkl

THIS AGENT WORKS BY KNOWING THE SEQUENCE LENGTH (cheating)
