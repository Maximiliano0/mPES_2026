'''
PES_Bayesian - Pandemic Experiment Scenario: Gym Environment and RL Algorithms

Provides the core simulation components:

- **Pandemic** (gym.Env):  OpenAI Gym environment that models a pandemic
  resource-allocation problem.  State = (resources_left, trial_no, severity);
  action = resources to allocate (0-10).
- **rl_agent_meta_cognitive**:  Entropy-based meta-cognitive function that
  computes confidence and simulated response times from Q-table values.
- **run_experiment**:  Runs multiple sequences through the environment using
  any action-selection function and collects performance metrics.
- **QLearning**:  Tabular Q-Learning training loop with epsilon-greedy
  exploration, linear epsilon decay, and optional seed for reproducibility.

Q-Table shape: (31, 11, 10, 11) = 37 510 cells
  → 31 resource states (0-30), 11 trial states (0-10),
    10 severity states (0-9, MAX_SEVERITY=9), 11 actions (0-10).

    """
    Implements the Q-Learning algorithm to train an agent in the Pandemic environment.
    
    Q-Learning is a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm that learns the value of taking
    actions in states. The agent learns by exploring the environment randomly (epsilon-greedy) 
    and updating a Q-table based on observed rewards and future state values.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    env : Pandemic
        The Pandemic environment instance to train on.
    learning : float
        Learning rate (alpha). Controls how much new information overrides old Q-values.
        Typical range: 0.1 - 0.9
    discount : float
        Discount factor (gamma). Controls the importance of future rewards.
        Typical range: 0.9 - 0.99. Higher values emphasize long-term rewards.
    epsilon : float
        Initial exploration rate. Probability of taking random actions.
        Typical range: 0.1 - 1.0. Higher values = more exploration.
    min_eps : float
        Minimum epsilon value. Exploration rate will decay until reaching this value.
        Typical range: 0.0 - 0.1
    episodes : int
        Number of training episodes to run.
    UsePreloadedReward : bool, optional
        If True, uses preloaded reward values from matrix R instead of environment rewards.
        Default: False
    R : array-like, optional
        Preloaded reward matrix. Shape: (available_resources, trials, severities, actions).
        Required if UsePreloadedReward=True. Default: None
    seed : int or None, optional
        Random seed for reproducibility.  When set, both ``numpy.random`` and
        ``random`` are seeded before Q-table initialisation so that identical
        hyperparameters produce identical training runs.  Default: None (non-deterministic).
    
    Returns
    -------
    ave_reward_list : list
        Average rewards computed every 10,000 episodes. Used to track learning progress.
    Q : ndarray
        Trained Q-table with shape (available_resources, trials, severities, actions).
        Contains the learned action values for each state.
    conf_list : list
        Confidence values (meta-cognitive scores) calculated by rl_agent_meta_cognitive 
        for each step across all episodes.
    
    Algorithm Details
    -----------------
    For each episode:
    1. Initialize environment with random sequence
    2. Use epsilon-greedy policy: random action with probability epsilon, 
       otherwise take best action (argmax Q)
    3. Execute action and observe next state + reward
    4. Update Q-value using: Q[s,a] += α * (r + γ * max(Q[s',a']) - Q[s,a])
    5. Move to next state
    6. Decay epsilon after each episode: ε -= (ε_initial - ε_min) / episodes
    
    Notes
    ------
    - Epsilon decay is linear across episodes
    - Q-values are initialized with random uniform values between -1 and 1
    - Average rewards are computed and printed every 10,000 episodes
    - Meta-cognitive confidence is tracked but doesn't affect learning
    - The environment is closed after training completes
    - State representation: [available_resources, trial_number, current_severity]
    - When *seed* is provided, results are fully reproducible across runs
      with the same hyperparameters.
