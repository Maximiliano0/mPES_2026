pes_trf — Configuration file.

Centralises every tuneable parameter for the Pandemic Experiment Scenario
(Transformer).  Values here apply to the experiment loop (__main__.py) and
the Transformer training pipeline (train_transformer.py).  Architecture
hyperparameters (d_model, n_layers, etc.) live in train_transformer.py.

Experiment Structure::

    Experimento (1)
    ├─ Bloque (8)
    │    ├─ Secuencia / Mapa (8)
    │    │    ├─ Trial / Ciudad (3~10)
    │    │    │    └─ Decision de Recursos (0-10)

Key Differences vs pes_base (baseline):
    - MAX_SEVERITY = 9 (same as pes_base)
    - SEED = 42 (fixed for reproducible training)
    - AVAILABLE_RESOURCES_PER_SEQUENCE = 39 (pes_base uses 49)

Sections:
    - Resource Allocation Settings  (budget, initial cities)
    - Data Files & Initialization   (CSV paths, random flags)
    - Decision Aggregation           (mean / median / mode selector)
    - Value Ranges & Limits          (severity, allocation bounds)
    - Experiment Structure           (blocks, sequences, trials)
    - Output & Logging               (file prefixes)
    - Player & Agent Settings        (RL_AGENT selection)
    - Pandemic Dynamics              (α / β multipliers)
    - UI & Interaction               (trust scale, fixed sequences)
    - Reproducibility                (SEED = 42)
    - Runtime & Persistence          (verbose, save flags)
